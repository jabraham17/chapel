The unmodified PLPA package is available at

Notable changes in this source directory, relative to the upstream:

+ Resolved incorrect CPU mask computation on 64-bit systems, as reported
  in GASNet bug 4688.

+ "Safer" `PLPA_CPU_*` macros, including (1) added parenthesis to avoid issues
  with operator precedence and (2) measures to avoid multiple evaluation of
  their arguments (in case they have side-effects).
