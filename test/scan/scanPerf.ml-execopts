# This test can run out of memory if there are co-locales because the amount
# of available shared memory may be less than the amount of physical
# memory. Until there is a better way for applications to determine how
# much memory they should use, scale the memory fraction by the number
# of co-locales.
#
# This should be revisited when
# https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/26786 has been resolved.
