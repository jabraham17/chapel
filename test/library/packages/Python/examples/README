Many of these tests use python dependencies from pip.
To facilitate running these tests with those dependencies in a custom virtual
environment, these tests respect the `CHPL_TEST_VENV_DIR` environment variable.
If this variable exists in the environment and is set to a valid virtual
environment directory, these tests will use that to find dependencies
