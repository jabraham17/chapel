─── warning in (unknown location) [ImplicitFileModule] ───
  An implicit module named 'nodoc' is being introduced to contain file-scope code.
  The following is the first file-scope statement:
  The implicit module 'nodoc' is being created because the above code is outside of any module declarations (e.g., 'module M').
  Note that all of the file's contents -- including module 'M' -- will be placed into the new 'nodoc' module.
