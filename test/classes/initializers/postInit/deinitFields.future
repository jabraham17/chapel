unimplemented feature: throwing postinits don't deinit fields

I suspect that addressing ../errors/errhandling/deinitFields.chpl
would likely fix this test as well, but wanted to add a separate test
to be sure.

One interesting question about this test is whether C.deinit() should
be called by the language as part of the cleanup in the sense that "We
completed all the init() calls, so it's initialized" or whether the
postinit()s are still considered part of the initialization, such that
by not completing them, we didn't complete the initialization of C.
The .good here is set up to not invoke C's initializer, but that's
arbitrary and I'm not trying to take a strong stance on the issue.
