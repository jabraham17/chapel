unimplemented feature: throwing initializers post-'init this' without helpers

It seems we can throw within initializers if we put the throwing
behavior into a helper function (see 'throwingViaHelper.chpl') but not
if we put it directly (this test).  This may be a known limitation in
the current, but the throwingInit.rst technote doesn't seem to mention
it and I didn't see a future for it in this directory, so am adding
this one.
