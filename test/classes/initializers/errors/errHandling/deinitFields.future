unimplemented feature: throwing initializers don't deinit fields

This test notes that when an initializer throws, we don't do anything
to deinit the object's fields, which it seems we must do to clean up.
Here, I've set up the .good assuming we would not call C's deinit()
because C was never fully initialized.
