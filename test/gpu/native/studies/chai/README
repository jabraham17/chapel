This directory is for nightly testing of the ChAI library using GPU support

The SKIPIF file runs before the tests directory. It clones chapel-lang's fork
of ChAI and applies any patches in the patches directory.

The tests directory should have a link to each test in ChAI/test with an
accompanying good file. If ChAI fails to clone, the tests will be skipped
