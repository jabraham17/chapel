I have not been able to match the output from Pytorch for this linear layer.
The output I get from Pytorch is something like:

‚ùØ python3 layerTest.py
Testing Softmax layer
tensor([[0., 1., 2.],
        [3., 4., 5.],
        [6., 7., 8.]])
tensor([[0.0900, 0.2447, 0.6652],
        [0.0900, 0.2447, 0.6652],
        [0.0900, 0.2447, 0.6652]])

See the layerTest.py file in the same directory for the Pytorch code.
There also seems to be a lot of confusion in the ChAI code about what
this Softmax function is supposed to be doing.
It seems that in the loadPyTorchDump this layer is being mapped to the
"LogSoftmax" module in PyTorch, which is not the same as the Softmax.

Moreover, Softmax in pytorch *must* be used with a dim argument, which
dimension along which Softmax will be computed (so every slice along dim will
sum to 1). But this function doesn't do that.

It also doesn't match up with Softmax2d in pytorch.
In short, this function is not doing what it is supposed to be doing,
but I don't understand what it is even trying to do in the first place,
because it doesn't correspond completely to a single function in PyTorch.
We'd have to ask the author.
