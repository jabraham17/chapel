This directory is for our nightly performance testing of miniBude
<https://github.com/UoB-HPC/miniBUDE>. Currently, the Chapel implementation
we're testing in a fork hosted at <https://github.com/milthorpe/miniBUDE>.

Note that the executable .skipif file runs before we start doing any testing
and will download the "latest and greatest" version of miniBUDE and the input
dataset before proceeding.

Also note that the .skipif file will silently skip the test if: CHPL_TEST_PERF
is unset or if the machine isn't able to access GitLab.

To run this test locally, execute the following commands:

    export CHPL_TEST_PERF=true
    start_test -perflabel gpu- .
