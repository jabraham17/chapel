This directory contains unit tests for colocales, including NIC selection.
The tests are based on Python's unittest and are contained in colocales.py.
The tests invoke the "colocale" executable, which is created by compiling
colocales.chpl with the "--library" argument to produce a library that is
linked against the colocales.c test harness. The sub_test script simply runs
all *.py files in this directory. The *.xml files contain hwloc descriptions
of the machine topologies used in the tests.
