  Potentially surprising shadowing for 'a'
       |
    15 |     writeln(a);
       |             ⎺
       |
  It refers to a symbol found through the 'use' of 'M1' here:
       |
    14 |     use M1;
       |         ⎺⎺
       |
  And then through the 'use' of 'M0' here:
      |
    6 |   public use M0 only b as a;
      |              ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  Leading to 'b' defined here:
      |
    2 |   var b: int;
      |       ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  But, there is a shadowed symbol 'a' defined here:
       |
    13 |   proc foo(a: real) {
       |            ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
       |
