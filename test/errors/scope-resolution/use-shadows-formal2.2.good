      |       ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  Redefined here:
      |

  It refers to a symbol found through the 'use' of 'M1' here:
       |
    15 |     use M1;
       |         ⎺⎺
       |
  And then through the 'use' of 'M0' here:
      |
    7 |   public use M0 only b as a;
      |              ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  Leading to 'b' defined here:
      |
    2 |   var b: int;
      |       ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  But, there is a shadowed symbol 'a' defined here:
       |
    14 |   proc foo(a: real) {
       |            ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
       |
