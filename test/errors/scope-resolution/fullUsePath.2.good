─── error in fullUsePath.chpl:9 [UseImportUnknownMod] ───
  Cannot find module or enum named 'ToLookFor'.
  In the following 'use' statement:
      |
    9 |                 use ToLookFor;
      |                     ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  The following declarations are not covered by the 'use' statement but seem similar to what you meant.
  
  A declaration of 'ToLookFor' is here:
      |
    1 | param ToLookFor = "??";
      |       ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  However, 'use' statements can only be used with modules or enums (and this 'ToLookFor' is not a module or enum).
