  Comparisons in the form 'x op y op z' are not supported.
  If you wanted to perform elementwise comparison, consider using the following instead:
  
      a < b && b < c
  
  If you wanted to use the result of a comparison as an operand in another comparison, consider using parentheses in a subexpression to disambiguate:
