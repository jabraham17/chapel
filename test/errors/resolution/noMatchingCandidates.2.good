  Unable to resolve call to 'fn': no matching candidates.

    6 |   fn(x);

  The following candidate didn't match because an actual couldn't be passed to a formal:
      |
    2 |   proc fn(const arg) {
      |           ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
    3 |     arg;
    4 |   }  
      |
  The actual 'x' expects to be split-initialized because it is declared without a type or initialization expression here:
      |
    5 |   var x;
      |       ⎺
      |
  The call to 'fn' occurs before any valid initialization points:
      |
    6 |   fn(x);
      |      ⎺
      |
  The call to 'fn' cannot initialize 'x' because only 'out' formals can be used to split-initialize. However, 'x' is passed to formal 'arg' which has intent 'const'.

  The following candidate didn't match because an actual couldn't be passed to a formal:
       |
    10 |   proc fn(arg:string) {
       |           ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
    11 |     arg;
    12 |   }  
       |
  The formal 'arg' expects a value of type 'string', but the actual was a value of type 'int(64)'.
       |
    14 |   fn(x);  
       |      ⎺
       |
  Formals with kind 'const ref' expect the actual to be a subtype, but 'int(64)' is not a subtype of 'string'.
