# .chplconfig test cases

# Note: Any line starting with '#' is considered a comment

# This config file is tested by setting CHPL_CONFIG to its directory
# and calling printchplenv

# Incorrect format:
CHPL_TASKS == fifo
CHPL_TASKS = = fifo
# entry with '=' still works`
CHPL_TARGET_CC = clang --gcc-toolchain=/usr
# entry can start with ''
CHPL_TARGET_CXX = '=/usr' # this is garbage for the purposes of testing

# Unacceptable variable:
CHPL_COMMS = none

# Duplicate entries:
CHPL_COMM = none
CHPL_COMM = gasnet
